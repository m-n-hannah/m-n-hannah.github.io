Voyant tools is a platform for conducting all kinds of textual analysis. Users can easily perform analysis and export data visualizations. 

1. Navigate to [Voyant Tools](voyant-tools.org).
2. You can either work with an existing corpus (a body of texts) or you can select your own from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and paste the link for the plain text page into the search bar for Voyant Tools.

3. Here I uploaded a text from the Moroccan explorer Abd Salam Shabeeny.

3. Click Reveal. You will open a platform with multiple windows for analyzing your text. Each window can be reconfigured and/or adjusted. 

4. The cirrus cloud provides a word cloud of the most frequently used words. The larger the word, the more times it appears. You can hover your cursor over a word to see how many times it appears.

5. We can also select and remove stop words from our corpus.
