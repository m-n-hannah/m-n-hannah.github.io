VosViewer is a tool for conducting bibliometric analysis. Bibliometrics is a field of study which focuses on the analysis of citations and keywords assocated with scholarly publishing. Such tools can help scholars understand the topography of the scholarly conversation as it appears in the literature. VosViewer works directly with several databases such as Scopus and Web of Science, but it also interfaces with Zotero or other citation management software. Users can collect their own library and then visualize the metadata using VosViewer.

Note: I have provided a sample dataset so you don't need to complete the Zotero step if you don't want to...

PART 1: ZOTERO
* Download Zotero and the Chrome Extension.

* Once you've downloaded the Zotero app and the Chrome extension, you can easily save the citation of any object to your Zotero Library. You will want to open Zotero, create a folder, and leave it open.
* Navigate to your library page and select a book or article. You can save the metadata to your Zotero by clicking the extension button in the top right corner of your browser.

* Once youo've saved a few items to your library, select all and click export. You'll want to export as RIS file.
