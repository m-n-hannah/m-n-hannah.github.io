Voyant tools is a platform for conducting all kinds of textual analysis. Users can easily perform analysis and export data visualizations. This tool was designed and built by Geoffrey Rockwell and St√©fan Sinclair. 

* Navigate to [Voyant Tools](voyant-tools.org).
* You can either work with an existing corpus (a body of texts) or you can select your own from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and paste the link for the plain text page into the search bar for Voyant Tools.

* Here I uploaded a text from the Moroccan explorer Abd Salam Shabeeny.

* Click Reveal. You will open a platform with multiple windows for analyzing your text. Each window can be reconfigured and/or adjusted. 

* The cirrus cloud provides a word cloud of the most frequently used words. The larger the word, the more times it appears. You can hover your cursor over a word to see how many times it appears.

* We can also select and remove stop words from our corpus. First select the switch icon by hovering over the banner above the wordcloud.

* Then you can select stopwords by language. The tool will auto-detect, but you can also modify the stopwords list.

* We can also see some statistics for the text in the statistics pane.

![voyant7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156235100-8ba090f5-4375-428b-ae61-d3917b550edb.png)

* And we can track trends over the course of the document.

![voyant8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156235247-a59a62a1-6d24-4494-a4be-f6d236c8b54f.png)

* We can look at word collocates as well.

* And Voyant comes with a staggering number of other visualizations and analysis methods, including topic modeling, named-entity recognition, and PCA analysis. You can explore these various methods on your corpus by selecting the window icon in any pane.

* Try out the bubblelines. This tool shows the usage of terms as bubbles over the space of the text.

* Or try the scatterplot, which allows you to visualize the words across your corpus via several dimensional reducing calculations such as Principal Component Analysis.

* Or perhaps a mandala visualization of the most common words across the corpus?

* These various data visualizations offer a nice range of possibilities for "seeing through your text."
