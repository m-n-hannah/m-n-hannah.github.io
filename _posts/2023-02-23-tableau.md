1.	Open Tableau Desktop.
2.	Notice the types of files and servers you can connect to. Tableau uses the language of connection because the tool doesn’t change your original dataset.
3.	Open the Pokemon dataset I sent you. What do you notice about the data? 
a.	There are 4 tabs open
b.	Top row is information
4.	Connect to the Pokemon dataset I sent you. It’s also available on Blackboard under week 2.
5.	When it opens, you’ll notice something interesting. What happened to the 4 tabs?
6.	Use Data Interpreter. This tool cleans data based on its interpretation. Sometimes it will cause errors, which is why Open Refine is great.
7.	If we want to, we can use Union to combine the different datasets. Drag Pokemon and Evolution datasets for example. You’ll notice some Null cells. Why might this be? Unions combine datasets and will look for common data to add them together such as “name.”
8.	Let’s go ahead and remove it. We’ll combine Pokemon and Moves.
9.	Now let’s click Sheet 1. Tableau offers some different options: Sheets, where data can be manipulated, dashboards where we can manipulate the aesthetics of our visualization, and stories where we can create narratives out of our data, applying some of Tufte’s calls for incorporating text, numbers, and visualizations.
10.	Let’s start with Sheet 1.
11.	You’ll see on the left said our different columns. These represent the columns in our two datasets. Each column will include a set of texts or numbers or coordinates.
12.	You can see that the data has been interpreted as both “Measures” (Numbers) and “Dimensions” (ABC) Tableau requires both to create visualizations.
13.	You’ll also see a panel called “Marks” which changes the way our data is processed.
14.	Our options include rows and columns.
15.	And we have a set of possible visualizations in the box on the right. The cool thing is that you can hover over each option, and it will show you what you need to make that viz work.
16.	Now let’s get our hands dirty. Tableau works in drag ‘n drop so you can select different combinations of data that you want analyze and visualize. Try it!
17.	You can see when I add two items, I now have options for visualization.
18.	I can choose a dimension or measure and drag it over a mark to change the way the data is visualized.
19.	If you drag a category that is a dimension onto the Filter box, it will allow you to select how the data is filtered for visualization.
20.	At the top, you can select “Fit width” or Fit height” to make the viz fit into the preview screen.
21.	You can also sort.
22.	We have a lot of NULL values in our data. We can choose to exclude them.
23.	Once you get a visualization you like, select Dashboard. We can now see our visualization is there. And we can drag it over and begin to do stuff.
24.	Let’s add an image by clicking Image in the Objects pane.
25.	Let’s add a text.
26.	Now let’s make it wider by changing our parameters.
27.	Change the name of your pokemon sheet.
28.	Now let’s go back to Sheets and make a new visual…
29.	Once you have two visualizations, select Story. We’re going to create a storyline of your data.
30.	In stories, you can select from either your stories or from your dashboards.
31.	Select the Layout you’d like and drag in your first sheet or dashboard.
32.	Add some text describing your data visualization.
33.	You can drag the order too.
