*	Open Tableau Desktop.
*	Notice the types of files and servers you can connect to. Tableau uses the language of connection because the tool doesn’t change your original dataset.

![tab1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156593639-db489df1-bec8-4270-8711-a6faa222d0c5.png)

* Open the World Bank C02 dataset I sent you. What do you notice about the data? Notice the tabs along the bottom. Each tab represents different datasets. 
*	Connect to the C02 dataset.
*	When it opens, you’ll notice something interesting. What happened to the tabs?
* Use Data Interpreter. This tool cleans data based on its interpretation. Sometimes it will cause errors, which is why Open Refine is great.

* Drag the tables you want to analyze. We will analyze C02 Data Cleaned and C02 in Kilotons.
* If we want to, we can use Union to combine the different datasets using various joins.
* Select a common column. In this case, country name should work!

* Select a relationship between the two datasets.

WORKSHEET
* Worksheets are represented by the first tab at the bottom of the screen. This is the space where you will create visualizations from your data.

![tab4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156596126-c8c9a2e6-6c87-4615-8daf-8cb95d487bdc.png)

* Drag  datasets from the left panel onto the blank space in the center of the screen. Or you can drag them onto the top or bottom panels at the top to represent either columns or rows.

![tab5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156602074-1e477c3c-9e22-4bcb-8176-b8eafffbbda9.png)

* At any time, you can remove a dataset by clicking on the down arrow and selecting remove. This way you can try visualizations and remove them if they don't work.

![tab6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156602388-051cbb4c-560c-4261-bd66-7b42c1b0761c.png)

* Tableau visualizes data according to three types: text (represented by a blue Abc, numbers (represented by a green hashtag, or geographical (represented by a blue or green globe). 
* Select the Show Me pane on the far right corner.  

![tab7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156602845-f39f6b7a-bb89-43fd-b39e-ddd5f1e02611.png)

* This panel will show you all the visualization options based on the data you have dragged into the operations area. If a visualization is "grayed out" it means you don't yet have the right data dragged into place. Each visualization will also tell you which data you need to make it work.

![tab8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156603285-4b6cd16b-3f19-42a0-b674-e603ef81285e.png)

* You’ll also see a panel called “Marks” which changes the way our data is visualized. Dragging data onto the various marks cards will change the appearance and interactivity of your data in various ways. For example, let's drag country name onto the column area and SUM(CO2(kt)) onto the rows (note that Tableau will automatically sum numerical data but you can change that by click on the down area and change to average or median).

![tab9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156603934-0c530fd3-e8bc-45b8-8e1b-572f56d3b358.png)

* Now let's drag CO2(kt) onto the color marks card and see what happens:

![tab10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156604296-0416eb18-03f3-44a4-bc40-6b15746564a0.png)

* Now I have a chart with colors representing CO2 output for various countries. Why is mine red? I clicked on the color marks card and select red/gold as a range for my data. Now you can begin to see the power of Tableau!
* If you want to fit all your data on the screen, you can select the size at the top from a drop-down menu.

![tab10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22083340/156604760-1bfae4de-e9a3-4922-a0b8-c603b7b4b520.png)

* Try creating a map in a new worksheet by using the Country Name data with CO2(kt) and selecting the map.

* You can easily save these visualizations to your Tableau Public account. 
* Rename your visualization by right clikcing on the Sheet 1 and selecting Rename.
* You can also do this by double-clicking on Sheet 1 at the top your map and opening the text editor.
