## Fulbright Specialist Workshops 
![Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Picture_of_Morocco.jpg)

This is a series of Digital Humanities Workshops offered by Matthew Hannah in March 2022 at Al Akhawayn University and Abdelmalek Essa√¢di University in the Kingdom of Morocco. This GitHub site will be a central hub for code, data, and instructions for these workshops, but I hope they will be widely used as well. 

In this series of workshops, attendees will learn the basics of various tools used in the digital humanities for research, teaching, and tinkering. Workwshops will cover data collection and cleaning, text analysis, data visualization, social media scraping, digital archives, and network analysis over the course of five days of intensive work. More importantly, these workshops are meant to prodvide a cultural exchange between our communities, universities, and nations.
