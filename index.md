## Fulbright Specialist Workshops 
### Series of Digital Humanities Workshops Offered by Matthew Hannah in March 2022 at Al Akhawayn University and University Abdelmalek Essaadi in the Kingdom of Morocco. This GitHub site is a central hub for code, data, and instructions for these workshops.

### In this series of workshops, attendees will learn the basics of various tools in the digital humanities for use in research and teaching. We will cover data collection and cleaning, text analysis, data visualization, TEI and digital archives, and network analysis over the course of five days of intensive work.
